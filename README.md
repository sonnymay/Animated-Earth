# Animated-Earth

Animated Earth is a web-based application that displays a rotating, animated 3D globe of the Earth using WebGL technology. The application is built using Three.js, a popular JavaScript 3D library.

Demo

Check out the live demo of the application at https://sonnymay.github.io/Animated-Earth/.

Features

Interactive 3D globe with smooth rotation animation
Customizable options for color scheme and camera position
Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
Optimized for performance using Three.js techniques such as geometry instancing and shader caching

Usage

To use the application, simply open the index.html file in a modern web browser that supports WebGL. The application has been tested and works well in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

Once the application is loaded, you can use your mouse or touch input to rotate the globe. You can also use the options in the menu to customize the color scheme and camera position.

Development

If you want to modify or extend the application, you can download or clone the source code from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/sonnymay/Animated-Earth.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Three.js as the main 3D library. To build the application, you will need a web development environment with a modern web browser and a text editor or IDE.
